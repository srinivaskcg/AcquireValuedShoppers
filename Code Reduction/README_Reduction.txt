Run Reduction_Category.py and Reduction_Company.py scripts in the offers.csv and transactions.csv folder.
This will generate the reduced_company and reduced_category datasets.
The generated datasets are merged by removing the duplicates using sort -u reduced_category reduced_company > reducedFile. 
We will use this reducedFile for further analysis in the project.
